                <p>Gerald Earl Gillum was born on May 24, 1989 in Oakland, California. His father, Edward, is a professor of art at California State University, Fresno, and his mother, Suzanne Olmsted, is an artist and teacher. He has a younger brother, James, who is a musician. After his parents split when he was in the first grade, Gillum and his brother were raised by their mom who worked two teaching jobs to keep their heads above water. But money was tight: all three of them shared a room at his grandparents' house. Gillum followed his mom's example, and worked for the Top Dog restaurant chain from the age of 14. "That's the only way we brought money in," he told Rolling Stone. "If I wanted something I had to go work for it."
